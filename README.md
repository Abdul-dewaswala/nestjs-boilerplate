# NestJS Auth0 Onboarding Application

This project is a robust NestJS application designed to integrate with PostgreSQL and Sequelize for data management, and Auth0 for secure user authentication and authorization. It includes features for user profile management, role-based access control, and a guided user onboarding flow.

## Features

- **NestJS Framework**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Sequelize ORM**: A promise-based Node.js ORM for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and SQL Server. Featuring solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication, and more.
- **Sequelize Migrations**: For managing database schema evolution.
- **Sequelize Seeders**: For populating the database with initial data.
- **Auth0 Integration**: For secure user authentication and authorization.
- **User Profile Management**: Integration with Auth0 to manage user profiles.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement authorization based on user roles and permissions defined in Auth0.
- **Guided User Onboarding Flow**: A structured process to guide new users through initial setup steps within the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- PostgreSQL database instance
- Auth0 account and application configured

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd nestjs-auth0-onboarding
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example` (to be created later) and configure your database and Auth0 credentials.

   ```
   # Database
   DATABASE_HOST=localhost
   DATABASE_PORT=5432
   DATABASE_USERNAME=your_username
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
   DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name

   # Auth0
   AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your_auth0_audience
   AUTH0_DOMAIN=your_auth0_domain
   ```

### Running the Application

```bash
# development
npm run start

# watch mode
npm run start:dev

# production mode
npm run start:prod
```

## Database Management

### Migrations

To run migrations:
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

To undo the last migration:
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
```

To create a new migration:
```bash
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name your-migration-name
```

### Seeders

To run seeders:
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

To undo the last seeder:
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo
```

To create a new seeder:
```bash
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name your-seeder-name
```

## Auth0 Configuration
